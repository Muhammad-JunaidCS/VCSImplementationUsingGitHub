  <h1 class="mainHeading">Version Control System Using GitHub</h1>
  <p>Version control, also known as source control, is the practice of tracking and managing changes to software code.
   Version control systems are software tools that help software teams manage changes to source code over time. As
   development environments have accelerated, version control systems help software teams work faster and smarter. They
   are
   especially useful for DevOps teams since they help them to reduce development time and increase successful
   deployments.</p>
  <p>
   Lets learn VCS(Version Control System) using GitHub.First of all you have to create GitHub account on <a
    href="http://github.com" target="_blank">github.com</a> and download git on your local computer. <a
    href="http://git-scm.com/download" target="_blank">Download From Here</a>.
   <br />
  </p>
  <p>After creation your GitHub acount click on plus symbol on right top and then click on new repository.</p>

  <p>

   You will be shown this page.Now create name for your repository and choose options of your choice and click on create
   repository
  </p>

 <ol>
  <li><b>git init</b></li>
  <p>Open directory in terminal and and initialize the empty git repository on local machine using commad <b>git init
   </b></p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitInit.PNG" alt="GitInit" class="center">
  <li><b>git status</b></li>
  <p>This command will tell you about files which are modifed,updated or deleted</p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitStatus.PNG" alt="GitStatus" class="center">
  <li><b>git add</b></li>
  <p>The command <b> git add File-Name </b> (which add particular file to stage area ) or <b>git add .</b> (which add
   all
   files of directory to staging area) </p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitAdd.PNG" alt="GitAdd" class="center">
  <li><b>git commit</b></li>
  <p>Once the files are in staging area, you can save them to commit history usnig coomand <b>git commit -m Message</b>
  </p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitCommit.PNG" alt="GitCommit" class="center">
  <li><b>git remote add origin URL</b></li>
  <p>Once the commits have be saved we can send this changes to GitHub.In order to do that we first have to link over
   local repository which we created using <b>git init</b> and that repository which we created on GitHub, using command
   <b>git remote add origin URL</b>
  </p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitRemote.PNG" alt="GitRemote" class="center">
  <li><b>git push -u origin Branch-Name</b></li>
  <p>Once the coonection between local repository and online repository has been established, we can push our changes to
   online or central repository so that data remain synchronous by using command <b>git push -u origin Branch-name</b>
  </p>
  <img src="./Pictures/GitPush.PNG" alt="GitPush" class="center">
  <p>After git push commnad you can see all the changes have be saved in central repository and it also show the no. of
   commits have been made so far.</p>
  <img src="./Pictures/CentralRepo.PNG" alt="Git Central repo" class="center">
  <li><b>git pull</b></li>
  <p>This commnad is used to pull the changes made in remote repository to local repository</p>
  <p>Consider if our local repository is synchronized with central repository but we we made changes at central
   repository as well
   as on local repository and try to push our loacl changes to online repository we will shown an error message like
   remote contain work that you donot contain locally so we have to pull the changes from remote to loacl first using
   command <b>git pull</b> and then push it back after selecting changes we want to retain in case of same line changes
   in central and local repository using command <b>git push -u origin Branch-Name</b></p>
 </ol>
